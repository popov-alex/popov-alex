### Hi there 👋

<!--
**popov-alex/popov-alex** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Modern JS applications
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and Redux with Spephen Grider
- 📫 How to reach me: ayp5xc@virginia.edu
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact:
I lived in apartment 404 of the dorm of my alma mater for five years.

No surprise, I became a lawyer and I could not find my way to coding.

This did not happen until I moved to apartment 100, where I reside now.

Everything is OK so far and I need to continue with my request.

I guess, my next apartment should have a number of 200, so I can finally break into Tech.
