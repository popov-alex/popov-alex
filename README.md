### Hi there 👋
- 🔭 I enjoy working on Modern JS applications using React and Redux
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Typescript and Redux Toolkit
- 📫 How to reach me: ayp5xc@virginia.edu
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact:

I lived in apartment 404 of the dorm of my alma mater for five years.

No surprise, I became a lawyer and I could not find my way to coding.

This did not happen until I moved to apartment 100, where I reside now.

Everything is OK so far and I need to continue with my request.

I guess, my next apartment should have a number of 200, so I can finally break into Tech.
