### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Modern JS applications
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and Redux
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ayp5xc@virginia.edu
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact:
I lived in apartment 404 of the dorm of my alma mater for five years.

No surprise, I became a lawyer and I could not find my way to coding.

This did not happen until I moved to apartment 100, where I reside now.

Everything is OK so far and I need to continue with my request.

I guess, my next apartment should have a number of 200, so I can finally break into Tech.
