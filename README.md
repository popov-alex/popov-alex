### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ As a full-stack engineer, I enjoy working with modern JavaScript applications, particularly those using React and Node.js.

âš¡ Fun fact: I spent five years living in apartment 404 of my alma mater's dorm. It's perhaps no surprise that I pursued law, unable to find my path to coding. It wasn't until I settled in apartment 100, where I currently reside, that everything seemed to click. I'm now on a tech journey, and I half-jokingly think my next apartment should be numbered 200, marking my full immersion into the tech world.
